# Slop Evader

Slop Evader is a browser add-on that searches the web for content posted prior to the first public release of ChatGPT, November 30th, 2022. Slop Evader rallies against false narratives of progress and assumes that the quality of the internet as an information retreival tool has been in rapid decline since the public uptake of generative AI (see dead internet theory). As media like images, video and text become untethered from any kind of reality, they become a space of pure culture, potentially generated from unknown datasets and contexts. The effect of this is that the cognitive load of searching, encountering and assessing the character of media has increased substantially. Everytime your attention is diverted to some piece of media, you must now ask yourself – is this real or is it AI? Is this old of new? Where has this come from? Slop Evader offers some respite. If you want to browse the web before the age of generated media, this tool is for you.

## FAQ

### How does this tool work?

If you search keywords using the Google or DuckDuckGo options, the extension simply restricts the search to the date range prior to November 30, 2022 on those respective platforms. It is not using its own search algorithm but just restricting other search engines to a date range prior to November 30, 2022.

I have been surprised to find that the native search options on the other web platforms (Reddit, Quora, Stack Exchange, Mumsnet, Pinterest and YouTube) cannot be strictly filtered based on date. For this reason, Slop Evader uses Google's search to query for posts on the platform but filtered by date.

### Why does Slop Evader return results via Google?

Google is one of the few search tools that offers strict date filtering. Even DuckDuckGo doesn't support site-specific searches combined with date filters the same way Google does.

### Will this tool solve our AI problems?

No browser add-on will save us. We need collective action and pushback that goes beyond individual tools to avoid AI. But I hope this project inspires more work and thinking on tools that support a politics of refusal. We shouldn't be satisfied with a status quo where out-of-touch billionaires get to shape the values, priorities and technologies we build as societies.

### But why Mumsnet?

Having a baby radically reconfigures your relationship to the internet. Suddenly you need strangers to tell you how to make a small human sleep, eat, shit, burb—the full catalogue of basic biological functions that often feel overwhelming until someone on a forum shares their experience on figuring it out.

I'm aware Mumsnet has become synonymous with transphobia for some of its members, and I'm opposed to transphobia in all its forms. But every platform here—Reddit, YouTube, the rest—hosts racist, misogynistic, and transphobic content. Many have done far less than Mumsnet to moderate it. So why does Mumsnet get singled out as irredeemably compromised while Reddit, still crawling with actual nazis, passes without comment?

Maybe it's worth noticing that a platform associated with women and mothers gets held to a different standard. Female-identified spaces are always under more scrutiny, always less credible. We live in a patriarchy that finds women less serious by default—even when we're just trying to figure out why the baby won't sleep.
